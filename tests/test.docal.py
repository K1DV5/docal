# The first side of the first triangle is
x_1 = 5 #m
# and the second,
y_1 = 6 #m
# Therefore the length of the hypotenuse will be,
z_1 = sqrt(x_1**2 + y_1**2) #m

#bar

# Now the second triangle has sides that have lengths of
x_2 = 3
y_2 = 4
# and therefore has a hypotenuse of
z_2 = sqrt(x_2**2 + y_2**2) #m,13

# Then, we can say that the hypotenuse of the first triangle which is #z_1 long
# is longer than that of the second which is #z_2 long.
